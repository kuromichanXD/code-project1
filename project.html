    <p class="para">My hobby is drawing in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to draw figures after completing my home work. I am 10 years old and read in class 5th standard. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got this naturally. Drawing keeps one always happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment and inspiration.
